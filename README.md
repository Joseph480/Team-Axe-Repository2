# Team-Axe-Repository
Repository for Unity projects during the 2021 Spring term under team leader Axe, hosted by Joseph Hart.

# Set up
When you open the project in Unity, make sure that your Version Control mode is properly set:
Got to Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor -> and search editor window for Version Control and make sure its mode is set to: Visible Meta Files
This will ensure that Github commits and pulls work!

It should already be properly set, since I commited the project after checking on it, but you can't be too safe.

P.S: Ver 2020.2.1f1 appears to have removed the Asset Serialization mode, and now that seems to work automatically. (?)
